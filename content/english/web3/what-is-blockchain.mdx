# What is Blockchain?

A **blockchain** is a distributed database that maintains a continuously growing list of ordered records, called *blocks*. These blocks are linked using cryptography. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

## Key Concepts

- **Decentralization**: Instead of a central server, the ledger is distributed across a network of computers.
- **Immutability**: Once data has been recorded, it cannot be altered retroactively.
- **Consensus Mechanisms**: Systems like Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake (PoS) ensure all nodes agree on the ledger's state.
