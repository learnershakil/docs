# Prompt Engineering

Prompt engineering is the art of communicating effectively with large language models to get reliable, structured outputs.

## Few-Shot Prompting

Provide examples to establish patterns:

```
Classify the sentiment of each review:

Review: "The product exceeded my expectations"
Sentiment: positive

Review: "Terrible quality, broke after one day"
Sentiment: negative

Review: "It works fine but nothing special"
Sentiment: neutral

Review: "Best purchase I've made this year"
Sentiment:
```

## Chain of Thought

Force step-by-step reasoning for complex tasks:

```
Solve this step by step:

Q: A server handles 100 requests/second. Each request takes 50ms.
   What is the minimum number of concurrent threads needed?

Think through it:
1. Each request occupies a thread for 50ms = 0.05 seconds
2. In 1 second, one thread can handle: 1/0.05 = 20 requests
3. To handle 100 req/s: 100/20 = 5 threads minimum

Answer: 5 concurrent threads
```

## Structured Output

```
Extract the following information as JSON:

Input: "John Smith, age 32, works at Acme Corp as a senior engineer
in the San Francisco office since 2019."

Output format:
{
  "name": "string",
  "age": number,
  "company": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "location": "string",
  "start_year": number
}
```

## System Prompts

```
You are a code review assistant. For each code snippet:
1. Identify bugs or potential issues
2. Suggest improvements with code examples
3. Rate severity: low, medium, high

Respond in markdown format. Be concise and actionable.
Do not explain basic syntax — assume the developer is intermediate level.
```

## Summary

- Few-shot prompting for pattern-based tasks
- Chain-of-thought for complex reasoning
- Structured output for reliable data extraction
- System prompts for consistent behavioral constraints
