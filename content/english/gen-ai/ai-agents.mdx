# AI Agents

AI agents extend LLMs with the ability to take actions, use tools, and reason through multi-step problems autonomously.

## Agent Architecture

```python
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def search_database(query: str) -> str:
    """Search the product database for items matching the query."""
    results = db.search(query, limit=5)
    return json.dumps(results)

@tool
def calculate_price(item_id: str, quantity: int) -> str:
    """Calculate total price including tax for the given item and quantity."""
    item = db.get_item(item_id)
    total = item.price * quantity * 1.08  # 8% tax
    return f"Total: ${total:.2f}"

# Create agent with tools
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(
    llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4"),
    tools=[search_database, calculate_price],
    prompt=agent_prompt,
)
```

## Memory Systems

```python
from langchain.memory import ConversationBufferWindowMemory

memory = ConversationBufferWindowMemory(
    k=10,  # Keep last 10 exchanges
    return_messages=True,
    memory_key="chat_history",
)
```

## Multi-Step Reasoning

Agents can break down complex tasks into sequential operations:

1. **Observe** — Parse user request and available context
2. **Think** — Plan the approach and identify required tools
3. **Act** — Execute tool calls to gather information
4. **Reflect** — Evaluate results and decide next steps

## Summary

- Tools extend LLM capabilities to interact with external systems
- Memory enables context retention across conversations
- ReAct pattern for structured multi-step reasoning
- Always constrain agent scope to prevent unintended actions
