# The Rust Ownership Model

Rust's defining feature is **ownership**, which allows Rust to make memory safety guarantees without needing a garbage collector.

## Rules of Ownership

1. Each value in Rust has an *owner*.
2. There can only be one owner at a time.
3. When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped.

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // s comes into scope

    takes_ownership(s);             // s's value moves into the function
                                    // and so is no longer valid here

    let x = 5;                      // x comes into scope
    makes_copy(x);                  // x would move into the function,
                                    // but i32 is Copy, so it's okay to still use x
}

fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) { // some_string comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_string);
} // Here, some_string goes out of scope and `drop` is called. Memory is freed.

fn makes_copy(some_integer: i32) { // some_integer comes into scope
    println!("{}", some_integer);
} // Here, some_integer goes out of scope. Nothing special happens.
```

By enforcing these rules at compile time, Rust prevents dangling pointers, double-free errors, and memory leaks.
